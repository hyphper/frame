# hyphperframe/h2-frame: Pure PHP HTTP/2 Framing

This library contains the HTTP/2 framing code used in the [hyphper project](https://github.com/hyphper). It provides a pure-PHP codebase that is capable of decoding a binary stream into HTTP/2 frames.

This library is used directly by hyphper to provide HTTP/2 frame decoding logic.

This library is based on the [Python Hyper "hyperframe"](https://github.com/python-hyper/hyperframe) project.
